                Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code,
                 is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron
                  Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include
                   support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent
                    code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
                     Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences,
                      and install extensions that add functionality.
                  In the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey,
                   Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment
                    tool among 86,544 respondents, with 73.71% reporting that they use it.
                     It increased its use among those learning to code versus those developing
                      as a profession (78% vs. 74%).Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor 
                      that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including C, C#,
                       C++, Fortran, Go, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Rust, and Julia. It
                        is based on the Electron framework,[21] which is used to develop Node.
                        js web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. Visual Studio
                         Code employs the same editor component (codenamed "Monaco") used in 
                         Azure DevOps (formerly called Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio 
                         Team Services).

                Web development tools (often called devtools or inspect element) allow web
                developers to test and debug their source code. They are different from
                website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that
                they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are
                tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application. 
                Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built-in features in modern
                web browsers. Browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer,
                Safari, Microsoft Edge and Opera, have built-in tools to help web developers,
                and many additional add-ons can be found in their respective plugin download
                centers.The built-in web developer tools in the browser are commonly accessed
                by hovering over an item on a webpage and selecting the "Inspect Element" or
                similar option from the context menu. Alternatively the F12 key tends to be
            another common shortcut. 1.When you want to work with the DOM or CSS, right-click
                an element on the page and select Inspect to jump into the Elements panel.
                Or press Command+Option+C (Mac) or Control+Shift+C (Windows, Linux, ChromeOS).
            2. When you want to see logged messages or run JavaScript, press Command+Option+J
                (Mac) or Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, ChromeOS) to jump straight into the
                Console panel.
